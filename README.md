# Lucky Shrub project in HTML and CSS
This is my project in HTML and CSS for the in-depth HTML/CSS module of Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate.

Lucky Shrub is a fictional gardening and landscaping company that offers design and maintenance services for gardens and also has a catalog of plants for sale.

This project is focused on website design and layout and uses a mix of CSS techniques like flex, grid, and also Bootstrap framework, which allows for responsiveness and adaptability of the website on different devices, like mobile devices.
